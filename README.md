### ⚛️ Frontend Overview

This project features a React frontend hosted on Vercel.
There is a focus on performance and feedback to the user, taking advantage of CDNs, lazy loading and Tailwind CSS. 

### 🛠️ Backend Overview

The backend consists of a Spring Boot application hosted on Railway, which integrates data from both a WordPress site and a Supabase PostgreSQL database.
WordPress serves as a temporary content source, with posts and categories synced periodically into Supabase. 
Eventually the site will transition away from using wordpress altogether. 

### 🔗 Overall

The backend exposes a RESTful API which is consumed by the React app. 
The overall architecture follows the MVC pattern, promoting clear separation of concerns and maintainability.

### 🎯 Closing

Thank you for viewing this project overview! This website represents my first professional software project, showcasing thoughtful UI/UX design, solid backend integration, and performance-conscious development. 
I hope it provides a clear picture of my approach and technical skills.
